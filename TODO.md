1. Take point in fundamental domain for Delta and return point in CP^1
   1. Figure out disc of convergence of series for phi
   2. ~~Python code that gives list of series coefficients (for possibly multiple series) to be passed to shader~~
   3. *(Low priority.)* Get the series around infinity working?
2. ~~Drawing code for leaves of quadratic differential~~
3. Modify coset representative code
   1. Package original code to make it more usable
   2. Figure out how to reassemble the fundamental domain to put all the vertices inside
4. *(Long-term test application.)* Take a bunch of Belyi maps with the same passport, draw dessins for all of them, and look for similarities between the dessins of the Galois-conjugate maps
