1. Take point in fundamental domain for Delta and return point in CP^1
   1. Figure out disc of convergence of series for phi
   2. ~~Python code that gives list of series coefficients (for possibly multiple series) to be passed to shader~~
   3. *(Low priority.)* Get the series around infinity working?
2. ~~Drawing code for leaves of quadratic differential~~
3. Modify coset representative code
   1. Package original code to make it more usable
   2. Figure out how to reassemble the fundamental domain to put all the vertices inside
4. *(Long-term test application.)* Take a bunch of Belyi maps with the same passport, draw dessins for all of them, and look for similarities between the dessins of the Galois-conjugate maps
   1. Draw fundamental domains for:
      1. ~~[Passport 7T6-7_5.1.1_5.1.1](https://beta.lmfdb.org/Belyi/7T6/7/5.1.1/5.1.1/)~~
      2. [Passport 7T6-5.1.1_4.2.1_3.2.2](https://beta.lmfdb.org/Belyi/7T6/5.1.1/4.2.1/3.2.2/)
      3. [Passport 7T6-7_7_3.2.2/](https://beta.lmfdb.org/Belyi/7T6/7/7/3.2.2/)
   2. Lay out web page for potential presentation at Bridges
      ~1. Learn about Javascript drag-and-drop for sort and check game mechanic~
      ~2. Make mock-up~
      3. Realize mock-up in HTML / CSS / JavaScript.
      4. Keep writing [copy](https://www.overleaf.com/project/602d325ad20f545c8b297465).
